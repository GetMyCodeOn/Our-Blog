<h2>End of Week One Summary</h2>

<h3>How do you feel after your first week at founders and coders? </h3>

<p><strong>JP:</strong> Pretty ecstatic! I feel like I've come on leaps and bounds since the first day, which basically consisted of me trying to keep my head above water! As a group, we pulled through the challenges and learnt more as a consequence of being thrown in at the deep end! It was uncomfortable to being with, not knowing anything but I feel like I've picked up much more as a result. </p>
<p><strong>ON: </strong>Wow! What an incredible week. I've feel like I've learnt so much in such a short space of time and yet have so much more to learn! The wealth of knowledge I feel like I have acquired in just one week is incredibly exciting. Bring on the next seven weeks! </p>
<p><strong>AR: </strong> Positively surprised! I expected the usual kind of taught learning environment and was slightly sceptical after day one having been thrown in at deep end! It's a very different learning style compared to university but I feel like I've learnt a lot more in a short space of time. Perhaps a balance of lectures and self-teaching would have been better!</p>
<p><strong>NZ: </strong> I feel really satisfied in terms of the amount I've learnt. I would say that I am able to make a fully functioning website which I didn't think I'd be able to do at the start of the week. Coming fresh from university I wasn't used to this type of working environment and I've had to adapt quite quickly but I've learnt much more in the process, both about myself, and technically. </p>

<h3>What was your favourite part of the week?</h3>
<p><strong>JP:</strong> I really enjoyed my role as presenter. I feel like I presented a lot of good stuff and was able to take pride in showing off the stuff we had accomplished as a group! </p>
<p><strong>ON:</strong> Friday was by far my favourite part of the week. The team really came together and worked well to complete the first assignment of designing a website. The beginning of the week had seemed so daunting and success improbable so to be able to achieve our goals as a team was really great!  </p>
<p><strong>AR: </strong>When we built our first website using Bootstrap that looked really good and was dynamic and moments where you feel like 'I really get this!'. </p>
<p><strong>NZ: </strong> Seeing how our website evolved over the week! On day two we had successfully made a website. It was really basic and really bad! By day three we had turned it into something I would be happy to publish on the internet. Looking at that change in just one day was incredibly fulfilling and represents how quickly you learn on the course. </p>

<h3>What was your least favourite part of the week?</h3>
<p><strong>JP:</strong> Definitely day one! I was very confused! </p>

<p><strong>ON: </strong> The end of day one! I think we all left feeling completely confused and frustrated. I had no idea what I was going on with terminal and GitHub and was slightly worried for the rest of the week! </p>

<p><strong>AR: </strong> Day one! I couldn't get GitHub to work properly and I found it very frustrating just sat there googling things! </p>

<p><strong>NZ: </strong> Day one, just because I left thinking how on earth am I going to get through the next 7 weeks! Day one felt really manic, but in hindsight I see the method in the madness! Coding is a lot about problem solving perseverance is an important skill to learn! </p>

<h3>The most useful technical skill you've learnt so far?</h3>
<p><strong>JP: </strong> Finally understanding what Jekyll and Bootstrap did after having spent a lot of time not understanding what they did! Dan's guidance really helped.</p>
<p><strong>ON: </strong> I think getting to grips with the terminal on my computer and all the useful functions it can do has been invaluable. Even if I don't pursue a career in software development I feel that it is important to know the basics of how the computer works. </p>
<p><strong>AR: </strong> Having the technical skills to access a vast number of resources that are available on the web and begin to work through and understand them; Bootstrap for example. </p>
<p><strong>NZ: </strong> Bootstrap!  Being able to use it as an inexperienced coder allows you to bypass some of the design stuff. You don't have to start form scratch but you still get the same results. It allows you to concentrate on playing around with creativity and develop technical skills too. It's a good tool for a beginner.</p>

<h3>Any advice for prospective candidates?</h3>
<p><strong>JP: </strong> Don't think about giving up on day one because you'll fell better by day four!</p>
<p><strong>ON: </strong> I've had a fantastic time on the course so far and have met an amazing group of talent individuals. It's been really exciting to work as a team to create something and would highly recommend the course to anyone! Be prepared to work hard though! </p>
<p><strong>AR: </strong> Go for it! Come in with an open mind and don't expect classic learning environment!</p>
<strong>NZ: </strong> Firstly, be prepared to work hard. Unlearn how you learnt before because it's such a different learning style! You need to be proactive and use initiative. Definitely do the course! Grad/entrepreneur/business owner/ ; whatever stage of your life and goals just do  it. It brings so much to you both in terms of personal and technical growth. </p>

<h3>What is your main goal for the end of the 7 weeks?</h3>
<p><strong>JP: </strong>To be able to create a fully functioning dynamic website. Not just based on twitter bootstrap! </p>
<p><strong>ON: </strong> I'd love to have a good understanding of many aspects of software development and feel confident in my ability to self-improve and learn further programming languages. </p>
<p><strong>AR:</strong> To feel comfortable offering my services or building my own product.</p>
<p><strong>NZ: </strong> To be able to be in a position where I could freelance and also where I can have a serious input into the technical side of my business. I would like to be sustainable. Not having to look to other people and having the technical knowledge to articulate what I want. </p>
