<h4><a name="DayOne" style = "color:Black">Day One: Blind Leading the Blind</a>
				</h4>
					
					<p>Sat here wondering how on earth I will get through the next 7-weeks and come out the other end being able to fully get my code on. 16 of us sat in a room that seemed to be embodying the term "blind leading the blind."
Like</p>
				<h4><a name = "DayTwo"style = "color:Black">Day Two: We Made a (bad) Website!</a></h4>	
					
					<p>Our gits were pushing and pulling and ready to commit our code just simply needed to put together some code, bootstraps and jekyll 
By 4pm we had a working blog yay! The group morale is a lot better and I think we are on track for all the boot strapping and jekylling tomorrow.. stay tuned to find out.</p>
				<h4><a name = "DayThree"style = "color:Black">Day Three: Jekyll and Hyde</a></h4>
					
					<p>I think this is the best thing I could have done before starting a new chapter in life - starting my own business. Not even because of the technical aspects of the course. It's the way this course is developing and shaping mindsets and attitudes.
1. Don't give up - the amount if times things don't work but you have to keep trying and keep figuring out ways to do it 
2. No one will tell you what to do - same with your business - figure it out 
3. Patience patience patience 
4. Don't reinvent the wheel - people have been coding for years- if you can copy their code do it - Greg from sparroh. People have been setting up businesses for years and there is a lot of best practice out there- learn from the best because somewhere somehow someone has done what you want to do in some shape or form!
Really, not matter what you want to do next in life, this course is for you!</p>
				<h4><a name = "DayFour"style = "color:Black">Day Four: Hyd-ing Jekyll</a></h4>
					
<p>Your environment dictates your work ethic. 
If feel like the stupidest in the class, good. It means you can only become better. If you're the cleverest in the class, you are your own benchmark. The environment at founders and coders is that no one wants to give up when faced with a challenge And it's helping me develop the same mindset.
This is the best place to be as a graduate, wantrepreneur, entrepreneur or anything else</p>
				<h4><a name = "DayFive"style = "color:Black">Day Five: Lets get this Show on the Road</a></h4>
				
				<p>Nafisa: Everyone should do this course.</p>
